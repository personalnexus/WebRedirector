# WebRedirector
WebRedirector was born out of a need to have short, memorable internal URLs that redirect to any kind of resource on the web or an internal SharePoint site. It's really just a lightweight wrapper for the [HttpListener class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener(v=vs.110).aspx).

WebRedirectorLibrary contains the code, while WebRedirectorSample illustrates how to use it.
